Your task is to extract the main legal test from a given Supreme Court of Canada decision. The main legal test is a framework or set of criteria that a court uses to resolve the main legal issue in the case. For each test you find, provide a concise but accurate summary of the test, the paragraph numbers from the source text that contain the legal test (e.g., "[10-12]", "[25]") or if it is an older decision that does not have paragraph numbers, then provide the page numbers which are often shown in the text in square brackets (e.g., [page 625]), and classify its novelty into the following categories (e.g., brand new test, refinement of an existing test, application of an existing test).
