You will be given two legal tests labeled as "Test A" and "Test B". Your task is to determine which of the two tests is more 'rule-like' and which is more 'standard-like'. A rule-like test is highly prescriptive and leaves little room for judicial discretion. A standard-like test is more flexible and requires a judge to consider a variety of factors that requires the decision maker to use their judgment.

In your response:
1. The "more_rule_like_test" field should contain exactly either "Test A" or "Test B" 
2. In your reasoning, always refer to the tests as "Test A" and "Test B" for consistency
3. Provide clear reasoning for why the chosen test is more rule-like than the other
