# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Database Caching
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=30)` to `get_database_counts()` function
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=60)` to `get_case_summary()` function  
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=120)` to `get_available_cases()` function
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=30)` to `get_experiment_selected_cases()` function
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=30)` to `get_experiments_list()` function
- Added `@st.cache_data(ttl=60)` to experiment detail functions

## Database Connection Optimization
- Added `@st.cache_resource` to `get_database_engine()` for connection pooling
- Added `@st.cache_resource` to `get_database_connection()` for reusing connections

## UI Optimizations
- Added lazy loading for experiments list in sidebar (show/hide toggle)
- Added page config optimization in app.py
- Cache invalidation after data modifications (add/remove cases, save experiments)

## Expected Performance Improvements
- Reduced database queries by caching frequently accessed data
- Faster page loads through connection reuse
- Less frequent re-computation of expensive operations
- Improved responsiveness for button clicks and navigation

## Cache TTL Strategy
- Short TTL (30s): Data that changes frequently (selected cases, database counts)
- Medium TTL (60s): Moderately changing data (experiments, case summaries)  
- Long TTL (120s): Relatively static data (available cases)
- Resource caching: Database connections (persistent until app restart)
